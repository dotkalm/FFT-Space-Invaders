# Space Invaders Using FFT

## ABOUT 
The movement in my Space Invaders game is directly linked to sound generated by the Web Audio API. This audio-controlled grid is a nod to how the original game's pacing was integrated with available hardware resources. In the original, eliminating aliens freed up processing power, which allowed the gameplay to accelerate.

## Gameplay
Audio signals control both the alien ships and the player. Frequencies generated by the alien audio signal indicate where each alien ship is positioned. When a frequency is removed from the alien signal, the corresponding alien ship disappears. The left and right arrow keys control the player's audio signal. Pressing the arrows shifts the player's frequency higher or lower, moving the peak left or right across the board.

## Mechanics
This game uses two analog signals generated by the Web Audio API:

One signal controls the invaders
One signal controls the player

Invaders:
Five rows of invaders (11 per row) totaling 55 invaders move left to right across the game board. Each invader is assigned a frequency evenly spaced between 2,000 and 22,000 Hz. FFT analysis detects peaks in the signalâ€”when a peak is detected, the corresponding invader is drawn on screen.
Player:
The player is controlled by a single frequency that moves up and down the frequency spectrum. FFT analysis detects the signal's peak, which indicates the player's position on screen. The right and left arrow keys (or H and L keys) increase and decrease the frequency, moving the player left and right.


## Debugger
a **debugger** is available by pressing the d key
the debugger shows a grid representing the game board to test hitting specific invaders
the debugger also shows the frequency and bin number for each invader and the player
